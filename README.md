# 02-margin-and-padding-2
In this project, I am once again working with padding and margin to control
how my content looks on a web page. Through this project, I now better
understand how these two properties interact with each other (ex. my initial
attempt had too much white space in the outer area of the card, and it was
because margin and padding were adding to that space). I spent a lot of time
figuring out how to center the text in the bottom box, because I was overthinking
it and thought I needed to find a solution other that "text-align: center" because
I thought this project hadn't taught that yet LOL
